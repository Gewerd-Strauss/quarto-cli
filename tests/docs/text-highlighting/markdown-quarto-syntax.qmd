# Example Client Credentials Exchange

This Quarto document is able to acquire an OAuth access token 
from a Service Account OAuth integration.

```{{python}}
from posit import connect

client = connect.Client()
# NOTE: get_content_credentials reads the `CONNECT_CONTENT_SESSION_TOKEN`
# from the environment to complete the credential exchange.
print(client.oauth.get_content_credentials().get("access_token"))
```
